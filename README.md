A cutting-edge integration of NVIDIA's DeepStream, TAO Toolkit, ROS 2 JAZZY, and Gazebo technologies for autonomous agricultural management, orchestrated through Docker containers on Jetson Orin hardware.

## Executive Summary

The Containerized Autonomous Agricultural Management System enables agricultural operations to deploy coordinated fleets of autonomous drones and ground robots for real-time crop monitoring, pest detection, and targeted intervention. Key features include:

- Real-time video analytics with <100ms latency
- Support for 8+ simultaneous drone feeds
- 95% pest detection accuracy
- Coordinated fleet management
- Containerized deployment for scalability
