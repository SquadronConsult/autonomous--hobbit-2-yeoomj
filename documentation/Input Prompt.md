The project integrates NVIDIA's DeepStream, TAO Toolkit, ROS 2 JAZZY, and Gazebo to build a fully dockerized autonomous system for agricultural management. Here's a detailed breakdown of the project:

### **System Overview**

The system employs a **Jetson Orin Supercomputer** as the central controller, orchestrating a network of dockerized drones (quadcopters) and ground robots to perform advanced agricultural tasks.

1. **Aerial Units (Quadcopters)**:

   - Equipped with cameras for real-time data collection.

   - Dockerized DeepStream pipelines analyze video feeds for plant identification, ripeness detection, and pest recognition.

2. **Ground Units (Bots)**:

   - Perform targeted interventions like pest removal and treatment applications.

   - Operate based on mission data provided by the Jetson Orin, with all processes containerized for consistency and ease of deployment.

3. **Simulation & Testing**:

   - Gazebo runs within containers to simulate environments, enabling rigorous pre-deployment testing of navigation, detection, and execution strategies.

   - ROS 2 JAZZY within Docker ensures seamless communication across all components.

### **Modes of Operation**

The system supports two fully containerized operational modes:

1. **Offline Mode**:

   - All data processing and AI inference are handled locally within Docker containers on the Jetson Orin.

   - Ideal for areas with no internet connectivity or high-security requirements.

2. **Online Mode**:

   - Extends capabilities by connecting to cloud services for data storage, advanced analytics, and additional training of models.

   - Field data is securely processed and synchronized through dockerized cloud pipelines.

### **Workflow**

1. **Data Collection**:

   - Drones collect imagery and send data to the Jetson Orin system.

   - Dockerized DeepStream pipelines process the data in real-time.

2. **Analysis**:

   - Visual data is analyzed within containerized TAO Toolkit models to identify pests, assess ripeness, and classify plant types.

   - ROS 2, running in Docker, coordinates task assignments.

3. **Execution**:

   - Ground bots execute treatments based on insights provided by the Jetson Orin, ensuring precise intervention.

   - All processing and mission execution are orchestrated through Docker containers.

4. **Feedback & Optimization**:

   - Field data is iteratively fed back into the system to refine dockerized AI models and improve accuracy.

This project showcases the power of a fully dockerized autonomous agricultural solution, providing modularity, consistency, and scalability for modern precision agriculture.
